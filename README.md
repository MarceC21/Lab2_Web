## Part 2 — After Closing Hours

### Game Description

**After Closing Hours** is an immersive, interactive fiction game developed in HTML and CSS.

You wake up trapped inside a shopping mall after closing hours with no way out. Navigate through dark corridors, mysterious shops, and suspicious locations while making crucial decisions that determine your fate.

Your mission is simple yet dangerous: **find a way to escape to the street and survive the night.**

### Story & Setting

You fell asleep in the food court of a shopping mall. When you wake up, the building is completely empty, the doors are locked, and an eerie silence fills the air. As you begin to explore, you realize you're not alone...

⚠️ **Warning:** Your choices matter. Some paths lead to freedom, others to eternal entrapment—or worse.
